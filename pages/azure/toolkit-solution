Use the static site as a portal that links to other websites.
Edits are made in markdown.

Problems:
Not mobile responsive
Header does not float
The columns and row size require manual adjustment, they do not automatically fit correctly to content.
The links have to be made to open in a new window instead of automatically, this means they are missed.
Duplication of links across toolkits (add as includes)
SME cant see when a file has been upload. He can get a notification now.
Uploading files
Arduous - If they have access to our library it could be a mess. What controls can we put in place.
Alternative for tracker.

Consideration:
Use ticketing system in Azure instead.
Drop off folder from feedback mechanism directly into a place for neha to find and she
gets a notification.
You can use conditional tags to populate the site for each audience.
