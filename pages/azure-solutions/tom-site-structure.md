Tom's structure:
His "home" page is a list of Blog posts with his main logo header in the topic
You can click either the top left banner to go home, or click home left corner. 
The top nav/icon is the same for other topics, except for API course
To the left there is a newsletter.
What other content can be put on the side where his ads are? Look at other sites.

When you click API course, the side nav goes to tech doc style.

The top nav brand icon has changed to reflect course topic.
Top nav is simplified. Click Blog to go back to home page
There is an about section, but it is simplified
There is a github link for repos.

There is a breadcrumb
Blog > Course Overview > Introduction

The course overview is a subitem under intro,
but is put first. Intro is a summary of tasks
so that makes sense.

His content:
Podcast he does
Site analytics
Blog posts about things he added to his courses
Commentary on podcasts he watched or articles he read
personal objectives as a tech writer not necessarily work related
